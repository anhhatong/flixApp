### Notes
I had some issues with "pod init" and had to look up solutions. The problems was that my cocoapods required a version update, so I "sudo gem update cocoapods" to have it up-to-date. Another issue was with the cell outlets. It took me a while to figure out that the referencing was corrupt, so I removed old references and reconnected the object labels to my table cell file.
